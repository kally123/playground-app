Perfect! I've created a complete Spring Boot + Angular + Docker playground application for you. Here's what you get:

## ðŸŽ¯ **What's Included:**

**Backend (Spring Boot):**
- REST API with full CRUD operations for task management
- H2 in-memory database with JPA/Hibernate
- CORS configuration for frontend communication
- Docker containerization

**Frontend (Angular):**
- Modern, responsive UI with task management features
- HTTP client service for API communication
- Component-based architecture
- Professional styling with hover effects and animations

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker Compose for easy orchestration
- Nginx configuration for frontend serving
- Production-ready Dockerfile setups

## ðŸš€ **Quick Start:**

1. **Create the directory structure** and copy the files as shown in the setup instructions
2. **Run with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. **Access your apps:**
    - Frontend: http://localhost:4200
    - Backend API: http://localhost:8080/api/tasks
    - Database Console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console

## ðŸŽ¨ **Key Features:**

- **Full CRUD operations** - Create, read, update, delete tasks
- **Real-time UI updates** - Instant feedback on all operations
- **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile
- **Professional styling** - Modern, clean interface
- **Docker ready** - One command deployment

The application is perfect for experimenting with:
- Spring Boot REST APIs
- Angular frontend development
- Docker containerization
- Frontend-backend integration
- Database operations

You can easily extend it by adding authentication, more entities, advanced UI features, or switching to a production database. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for both Spring Boot and Angular development.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation or help you add additional features?
